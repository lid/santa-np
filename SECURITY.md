# Reporting a Vulnerability

If you believe you have found a security vulnerability, we would appreciate a
private report so that we can work on and release a fix before public
disclosure. Any vulnerabilities reported to us will be disclosed publicly
either when a new version with fixes is released or 90 days has passed,
whichever comes first.

Report the vulnerability [through GitHub](https://github.com/northpolesec/santa/security/advisories/new).
